College enrollment linked to vietnam war

Men who came of age in the Vietnam War accumulated more college education than those maturing either before or since, a Government study has found. The researcher who prepared the study said the change was probably caused by a combination of some men's avoiding the draft and others' using the G.I. Bill.

The percentage of young men attending college climbed rapidly from 1966 through 1972 and then began declining, the Census Bureau reported, while attendance by women continued to climb, although more gradually.

''College attendance to maintain a draft deferment most likely caused an increase in college enrollment rates among young men in the 1960's, and the elimination of the draft in the early 1970's probably had some negative impact on enrollment rates in succeeding years,'' said Rosalind R. Bruno of the Census Bureau in her report, ''Educational Attainment in the United States.''

The bureau reported that the college enrollment rate for civilian men 18 to 24 years old rose to 36 percent in 1969 from 24 percent in 1960 and then dropped to 27 percent in the mid-1970's, as the draft was dropped. The last draftee was inducted into the armed forces in June 1973. 

Benefits Tied to Attendance

In addition to students seeking draft deferments, the report said, ''Veterans with G.I. Bill benefits attended college in the mid-1970's, but as these benefits expired, attendance declined.

''The result appears to have been that men eligible for the draft during the Vietnam era received more education than they would have under normal circumstances. On the one hand, some men had additional incentive to remain in school to maintain their draft deferments, while on the other hand, some received additional years of education because of the G.I. Bill.''

The report compared rates of college attendance for men 25 to 29 years old to illustrate the study.

In 1966, of men in that age group, 30.1 percent had completed at least one year of college. By 1971 some 37.9 percent had finished one year and in 1976 more than half, 50.1 percent, had at least one year of college behind them.

But by 1981 the share of men in that group with a year or more of college fell to 45.7 percent.

''The higher rate of college attendance by young men during the late 1960's and early 1970's led to the higher attainment levels achieved by men born from 1947 to 1951,'' the report said.

While the men born in 1952 and thereafter may eventually catch up, the report said, it said there was no evidence that they will match the preceding group. Beginning of Baby Boom

In addition to being affected by Vietnam, the group born from 1947 to 1951 represented the beginning of the post- World War II baby boom.

Their parents were more affluent than the parents of earlier classes of students, the report said, adding, ''They were part of a group so much larger than that preceding them and were subject to increased competition, which may have resulted in higher aspirations.''

A commonly offered explanation for the subsequent decline in college enrollment rates has been the decline in the economic attractiveness of a college degree caused by the glut of graduates.

But the decline in male enrollment has not been matched by that of women, whose college enrollment has been increasing steadily.

Comparing the same 25-to-29 age group, the share of women with one or more years of college shows a gradual increase through all four years checked.

Women 25 to 29 years old with at least one year of college totaled 22.7 percent in 1966, 29.4 percent in 1971, 38.4 percent in 1976 and 40.9 percent in 1981.

Overall American education levels have risen significantly over the last three decades, the report found, and more than 70 percent of Americans over the age of 25 had high school diplomas as of March, 1981. That is up from 56 percent in 1971 and only 34 percent in 1950.
